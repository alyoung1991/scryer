				A Scryer is one who can see the future.<br><br>
				In our view, the future of rum begins now. It is being defined by those bold enough to redefine the category without artificial additives, post-distillation sugar or caramel coloring. Scryer is made in the style of Scotch whisky: pot-distilled, oak aged and finished in unique, purposeful wine casks. Originally distilled in Barbados from highest-quality molasses, we age our rum for a minimum of 5 years in white American oak before transferring into Port and Sherry wine casks for further aging. This wine barrel aging, known as finishing, occurs in the heart of Old San Juan, the oldest city in the Americas. 
				<br><br>
				It is here, in the rum capital of the world, that we blend, bottle and label our hand-crafted rum. From the former ruins of a 1920's port-side crystal shop, building #259, on the historic Prohibition-era Calle Tetuan, we invite you to join us for rum, cocktails, and a story about the long journey and adventure that is Scryer Rum.
				Scryer Rum is the shared dream of two avid spirits enthusiasts - one, a student of Scotch whisky; the other, a rum fanatic in search of the perfect bottle. 
				<br><br>
				In 2015, Garrett Robinson and Derek Schwarz took a seat in a crowded whiskey bar. Amongst hundreds of bottles of Single Malt Scotch and Bourbon, they detailed their plan to bring pot-distilled rum finished in top-quality wine barrels to the mainland United States. The synergy of skills was undeniable: Garrett was an industry veteran with experience brewing, distilling, and barrel-aging fine spirits. Derek was a mechanical engineer with a reverence for small details and a knack for bringing wild ideas into reality. 
				<br><br>
				Plans changed suddenly in 2017 when Hurricane Maria ravaged much of the island of Puerto Rico, the home of Derek's mother, family, and grandfather's agricultural farm in the mountains of Sabana Grande. With Garrett's help, Derek began establishing wind- and solar-powered systems in an effort to restore electricity to those in desperate need. In light of their experiences following the hurricane, the duo resolved to remain in the Caribbean, developing the Scryer Rum dream in the mountains of Southern Puerto Rico, on the very same family farm.
				<br><br>
				In 2018, Scryer Rum found a new home on historic Calle Tetuan, a port-facing, Prohibition-era street in Old San Juan. In the ragged shell of building #259, a once-infamous punk-rock outlet and live venue near today's main cruise port, the two began removal of debris and reconstruction by hand. 
				<br><br>
				As construction settles and debris is cleared away, we watch with pride as barrels, rum, and excited patrons begin to refill the building's formerly tattered halls. We can't wait to share with our new family and friends five years of passion and dedication. Welcome to Scryer Rum!
